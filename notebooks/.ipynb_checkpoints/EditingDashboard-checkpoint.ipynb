    "    It was quite peculiar that *this* woman - of all people - just so happened to be in *this* place, at *this* time, if only for the very simple --yet quite inexplicable-- fact she hand't yet been born, and wouldn't for another five months. Perhaps even more unexplainable was the fact that not only was she fully grown, but also she possessed the knowledge gained from countless thousands of past incarnations. But none of that was relevant at the moment. There *were* more pressing issues at hand. There was no time to waste arguing the semantics of escaping time loops, and after all -- she was not your average woman anyway.\n",
    "    The mystery of her presence was quite unimportant in retrospect. How she had gotten there, inconsequential. All that mattered was she Had arrived, and so had they. He would be arriving soon, and things had  best be in place be for he did. Everything *must* be in order before he appeared -- For indeed the world *had* been awaiting his return for a very long time.\n",
    "    Things were taking place that would soon affect the very framework of reality, touching every portion of existence. Nothing would be the same. Thus was the topic of conversation this night between three key individuals.\n",
    "---\n",
    "#\n",
    "---\n",
    "    \"You do realize of course just what this plan of yours means?\" she asked sternly, gazing out of the window as lightning crashed all around. The Storm inched ever closer to them.\n",
    "    \"I know of *no other* option... The Connection *must* be made.\" replied the man with green eyes, his voice detached and somewhat fearful tone.\n",
    "    \"I'm afraid this has become something far more demanding than any of us ever dreamed.\" the other man said. He sat calmly in a recliner nearby, smoking a long pipe, his face wrinkled with concern. They both loved him so deeply. The three of them had been together for so long--fighting the same foe--and while she might not have been prone to showing her weakness before mere mortals, he knew he wasn't alone. They both found it hard to believe just what the man with green eyes was considering. So much pain, yet none of it seemed necessary. Then again, no one had asked their opinion.\n",
    "    After a long pause, the woman said in a contemplative tone, \"There simply *must* be another way! He shouldn't have to...\" she stopped suddenly, realizing what she'd nearly said. The words had slipped out, unbidden.\n",
    "    \"*That* is precisely why he *must*!\" came a fourth voice, one *very* familiar to all three.\n",
    "    Their eyes turned in unison towards the darkened corner the intruder occupied. This was supposed to have been a private meeting. How had he found them? The woman, whose presence before had been a calming and peaceful emanation--Her attempt at helping her two friends cope--suddenly, turned a darker shade. Within an instant her anger kindled to such a degree her companions began trembling with an uneathly and holy fear. Her ferocity seemed to shake the very fabric of reality, fracturing the air around them. None of this seemed to frighten the intruder in the least. He just stared back at her, a serene look upon his face and he strolled closer into view.\n",
    "    \"How *dare* you!\" she roared, the lighthouse shuddering in her wake, \"How dare you bring your nonsense *here* of all places! This is more than a man's *life* we're talking about, not some whimsical concept in your befuddled mind! A man, who just so happens to be a very *dear* friend of mine. Yet *still* you've come uninvited and with you brought the audacity to spout off your insane ramblings and--as always-- speaking with that same venmous tone as you always do, as if *we* are the uninformed!\"\n",
    "    He said nothing in retort, but instead looked deeply into her eyes. The man had appeared silently. He hand't used a door. In fact, he didn't even climb the stairs to the top of the lighthouse where the three had gathered, and indeed, he had *not* been invited, but such things didn't matter, and yet was another reason he remained unafraid of this dreadfully perilous woman. They all three needed him, and they knew it--regardless of how illaccepted his presence was.\n",
    "    \"...But... he's right...\" said the man in the chair, a forlorn look upon his face as he paused in his smoking.\n",
    "    \"Indeed I am.\" He glared menacingly at the woman as he strolled all the more into view, \"I would *think* one of *The Preori* would *know better* than to confuse her *emotions* with the *facts*! Perhaps my dear, it's simply your humanity *finally* shining through?\" he asked with a slight smile forming upon his face, eyes twinkling in the dim light. He winked surreptitiously to the man in the chair.\n",
    "    The woman turned upon him again, but before she could unleash her rage, she was interrupted.\n",
    "    \"Listen you two...\" the man with the green eyes paused thoughtfully, \"it is *my* choice. You know he is already on his way--even now--We don't have *time* to sit around arguing. We know what *must* be done. There's only one way to ensure *The Connection* is made. Otherwise they'll delay it for as long as they can. You know how they work. *The Game* is rigged, and I know it goes against everything we stand for, but *if* we're going to win this war...\" he paused again, as if seeking the courage to continue on, \"and we *must*...We're going to *have* to get our hands dirty. There's simply no way around it.\"\n",
    "    The intruder interrupted once more--he was quite good at that, \"And *I* can think of none better suited to tread so deeply into darkened territory than you, and see to it the job gets done.\" he said satisfactorily.\n",
    "    The man in the chair covered his face in pain. The intruder *was* right, and now, all three of them knew it. The woman suddenly looked as if the wind had went out of her sails. The strange man's words cut through her like a knife, and right to the bone as so often they did. She *was* being emotional, just as he said, and *indeed*--it *was* due to her inability to deal with her... *unique* nature that was causing her to remain so thoroughly rattled. She hated how he always did this to her. Why had *she* been cursed with the blessing of existing in two worlds simultaneously? It *was* difficult being the only of her kind in all of existence. She had none with whom she could relate, and sometimes, *this* was the hardest part.\n",
    "    The green-eyed man thanked the intruder with a nod then continued, \"Listen I know none of this seems fair... to either one of you. Hell--none of it seems fair to me either. I'm not even sure I *can* do it. The fear alone is...\" his voice faltered, \"The thought itself is paralyzing... but... it *must* be done. This is after all just a game. A wicked one... but a game, neverhteless. I know what I mean to both of you. To say goodbye *indefinitely* is near unbearable for *me*, especially since it's all just a gamble anyway.\" he paused again, \"Things are so fragile and ... Unforseeable, but there's no way around it. *Someone* *has* to at the very lease try! We know He will remain to weak, unaware and forgetful to be of any use at all until *The Connection* has been made. Our only purpose is to ensure he is protected until that time comes.\" he took a deep breath, \"This *has* to end. All of it. All of these unsuspecting people... If we won't do it for the sake of getting the job done, then at least let us persist on their behalf. This *has* to end... It just...\" The green-eyed man's voice broke again with emotion as he remembered the true horror of what they were up against, \"It just... *has* to...\"\n",
    "    The intruder sighed pleasantly. He work was done. As usual, he'd completed his task without putting forth much effort at all. In fact, most of the time his mere presence was all that was necessary. It *had* been a long and arduous road. For ages it seemed he had interferred with the Dark Ones. It often left him isolated, even from his somewhat *mistrusting* allies. They never seemed to listen. They never chose to understand. But what he'd just heard comforted him greatly. The green-eyed man finally understood what was required, and even more, was willing to follow through. The intruder could ask for nothing more. Things must play out as they would.\n",
    "    You see, this was no ordinary man who was even now on his way. This was the *trump card*. The incalculable anomaly, sent to undo all of the evil instituted by *The Game*. *He* was the one they spoke of. The man referenced so frequently in *The Book*. All that remained was to wait for him to arrive, now that the green-eyed man understood his own path.\n",
    "    The woman sighed in frustration, \"I understand *why* such things are necessary. I...I just don't want to lose you. I've witnessed the two of you lose so much and it's heartbreaking enough... I'm not sure I can handle...\" her voice trailed off until she spoke mainly to herself, \"...Humanity is so... frail...\" she whispered."

    "# Chapter 1 : Follow Me - Complete Edits\n",
    "\n",
    "    He walked into Brian's life with very little warning or discretion at all, and though it was not a complete surprise--for Brian had knowledge of his own--A sliver of fear crept its way into his heart. The man had used his *real name* for one, and Brian had never met the man before. It was peculiar indeed. Strangers didn't often know his *real* name. Brian was in for a wild ride, and despite all that would soon come crashing into his life, fate could not have picked a more pecuiliarly *mundane* setting. Our story begins in a coffee shop one morning, as Brian sat there, checking his email.\n",
    "    \"Brian McCord, what are you doing with your life?\" the stranger asked abruptly, mocking him it seemed. No introduction. No opening woords. Just a blatant and somewhat rude, attention grabbing jeer. To Brian the man seemed fully intent on catching him off guard. However, Brian wasn't prone to such things.\n",
    "    He turned around, half expecting this. He'd felt it coming for some time. Though he had not known just when or where such a thing would manifest. When Brian looked up, the man was glaring back at him, eyes green and menacing. As it was not in Brian's nature to wear this emtions on his sleeve, he calmly lowered his sunglassings, meeting the gaze. Brian's steely grey eyes pierced into the man with a matched intensity. He smirked, attempting to throw *the stranger* off of *his* game.\n",
    "    The Stranger frowned knowingly, shaking his head, \"Oh don't give me that! You're absolutely terrified!\" he exclaimed, a sinister smile creeping across his face, his voice ending in a hiss, \"Do you know *who* I am?\", eyes flaring which hinted at some dark and hidden hunger. The stranger moved like a snake, repositioning himself in front of Brian's table.\n",
    "    At this Brian casually took his sunglasses the rest of the way off, laying them down and taking a drink of his coffee as if bored, but when he looked again, the man was nearly breathing down his throat.\n",
    "    \"It is time!\" he hissed, green eyes flashing with lightning it seemed. \n",
    "    Brian didn't so much as flinch, though... He probably should have. After all, he *hadn't* seen the man move, not even in his peripheral. One moment he'd been a safe distance away... and the next, he'd invaded Brians personal space, again - Intentionally.\n",
    "    Brian maintained his bored demeanor, \"And you ser are?\" he inquired nonchallantly.\n",
    "    An evil and knowing smile formed upon the stranger's lips, raising his eyebrows suggestively as he said, \"Oh... Don't you worry about that... Just follow me!\" and with that the strange man turned swiftly around, one arm behind his back as he strode confidently towards the door and upon exiting the cafe, flung the door open with a shove so forceful it nearly knocked over the elderly couple seeking to enter at that same time. He muttered something Brian couldn't make out however that appeared to offend the couple so much that nearly being hit with the door seem trivial at best. Odder still, he didn't so much as look back to make sure Brian followed, even after such a rude display of theatrics.\n",
    "    ...But Brian did follow. He didn't know why. He didn't even ponder it much. His feet began moving before he realized it, and for some reason, he let them go. It was as if he were being pulled by a current, against which there *could be no fighting*. That is not to say he necessarily *wanted* to combat it. Brian had known of this day for many years, and though he dreaded to see its arrival--partially for reasons he didn't yet understand--something about the man intrigued him. Plus, he was due for a date with a cigarette, and smoking wasn't allowed inside.\n",
    "    This was the excuse he used to quell the arrogance in his mind,  which seemed to disagree with him showing any interest in the least. You see, the *strangeness* of this event was not what led him to gather his laptop, coffee, and half-eaten breakfast. It was not the man's strange movements or speed which caused him to place his belongings into his car, lock it, then look around for the direction he had taken. No, not even the odd glimmer in the man's eyes which seemed more compelling than his knowledge of Brian's name had set his feet to walking, lighting a cigarette once he'd spotted him. None of this interested Brian at all. However, it was the *inexplicable* strangness of the walk itself that caused him to increase his pace, and this was very out of character for the young man. \n",
    "        Brian had noticed, by chance as it were, just how fast the man was walking and yet--somehow--the distance between them stayed fixed. Brian you see began following at his usual slow and steady, almost half-bored pace, unconcerned--or so he thought--with whether or not the man escaped his field of vision, but when Brian made *this* odd observation, he decided it best to test the crazed idea that surfaced in his mind. With all that had just transpired in the last few moments, what could it hurt to just *go with the flow*?\n",
    "        He began at first to walk slightly faster, gaging his speed with the steps of the strange man, who, as Brian also noted, had not bothered to look back, *not even once* to check on his progress. When it became apparent to him that the man had not sped up, nor that the distance between them had changed in the slightest--for Brian was exactly a full block behind him--He broke out into a slight job, carefully watching to ensure the man was indeed *still just walking*. Sure enough, the man's gait had not adjusted... but then again, neither had the distance between them.\n",
    "        This was not the first time somthing of this nature had appeared in Brian's life. He was twenty-three now, and until this point he'd always experienced periods of time--which fizzled out eventually--wherein it seemed as if the whole of the universe--God as some may call it--were attempting to tell him... *something*... Several times he'd followed hopelessly after various \"signs and wonders\" only to be let down in the end, as his extra-sensory perception of the world slowly slipped away into oblivion, leaving him questioning everything all the more.\n",
    "        He'd written it off as a dream the first time he'd been approached in a like manner. He was only nine at the time, though the man he'd encountered then had been quite the opposite of this *new stranger*. He had made a point of ignoring all of the other odd people who'd come afterwards, each saying strange things and beckoning him to follow them. Despite this he'd never managed to shake his questions as to just *who* that first man had been.\n",
    "        At nineteen he sat for weeks, alone in his bedroom poring over a large stack of books and compiling hundreds of seemingly deranged and disjointed notes. When he emerged, he ventured into the wilderness nearby and found that very same man in a small cabin, deep in the obscure forest... At the very least he knew that man was indeed real and not just some figment within his imagination. This revelation had troubled him deeply. When the man asked how he'd come to find his cabin, Brian had said that he'd simply \"Followed The Stars\".\n",
    "        By twenty-one he'd grown quite comfortable with the apparently hidden realm of knowledge he'd somehow stumbled upon which seemed so contradictory towards what most considered \"Reality\". Indeed, there had often been times throughout Brian's life when random things--seemingly unrelated events--would occur in accordance with his thoughts, as though everything around him knew him personally. For the most part, by now he'd learned it best simply to ignore such sensations. Nevermind the fact he could no longer explain away the existence of the man in the cabin--He'd realized rather painfully however, that far too often following after such strange thoughts always left him at a dead-end. A barren space--wherein things were neither resolved, nor truly broken.\n",
    "        He'd also learned it was best to keep quiet about such things after one evenings chat with his sisters--one older, the other younger. They'd immediately pointed him in the direction of a psychiatric ward, citing various articles on the dangers of *schizophrenia*. He actually had taken their advice at one point. A time when his mind seemed to be unravelling by the seams, but when he'd told the doctor he feared he was going insane, the man had laughed at him, then reassuringly said, \"No my boy, you see, crazy people don't *know* they're crazy.\" and suggested he simply try to get more sleep. \n",
    "        Braight tried to take everything in stide, and despite possessing a very powerful \"sixth sense\" or intuitive notion about *most* things, he now rarely let himself become too enmeshed with the narrative's inherent drama. He routinely ignored the underlying strangeness of the world around him, blending it all in rather nicely with the rest of the odd characters he encountered--people who seemed to know him in some fashion or another--which is why his reaction on *this* day was quite out of the ordinary indeed.\n",
    "        He began running after the jogging experiment failed to "
