    "    It was quite peculiar that *this* woman - of all people - just so happened to be in *this* place, at *this* time, if only for the very simple --yet quite inexplicable-- fact she hand't yet been born, and wouldn't for another five months. Perhaps even more unexplainable was the fact that not only was she fully grown, but also she possessed the knowledge gained from countless thousands of past incarnations. But none of that was relevant at the moment. There *were* more pressing issues at hand. There was no time to waste arguing the semantics of escaping time loops, and after all -- she was not your average woman anyway.\n",
    "    The mystery of her presence was quite unimportant in retrospect. How she had gotten there, inconsequential. All that mattered was she Had arrived, and so had they. He would be arriving soon, and things had  best be in place be for he did. Everything *must* be in order before he appeared -- For indeed the world *had* been awaiting his return for a very long time.\n",
    "    Things were taking place that would soon affect the very framework of reality, touching every portion of existence. Nothing would be the same. Thus was the topic of conversation this night between three key individuals.\n",
    "---\n",
    "#\n",
    "---\n",
    "    \"You do realize of course just what this plan of yours means?\" she asked sternly, gazing out of the window as lightning crashed all around. The Storm inched ever closer to them.\n",
    "    \"I know of *no other* option... The Connection *must* be made.\" replied the man with green eyes, his voice detached and somewhat fearful tone.\n",
    "    \"I'm afraid this has become something far more demanding than any of us ever dreamed.\" the other man said. He sat calmly in a recliner nearby, smoking a long pipe, his face wrinkled with concern. They both loved him so deeply. The three of them had been together for so long--fighting the same foe--and while she might not have been prone to showing her weakness before mere mortals, he knew he wasn't alone. They both found it hard to believe just what the man with green eyes was considering. So much pain, yet none of it seemed necessary. Then again, no one had asked their opinion.\n",
    "    After a long pause, the woman said in a contemplative tone, \"There simply *must* be another way! He shouldn't have to...\" she stopped suddenly, realizing what she'd nearly said. The words had slipped out, unbidden.\n",
    "    \"*That* is precisely why he *must*!\" came a fourth voice, one *very* familiar to all three.\n",
    "    Their eyes turned in unison towards the darkened corner the intruder occupied. This was supposed to have been a private meeting. How had he found them? The woman, whose presence before had been a calming and peaceful emanation--Her attempt at helping her two friends cope--suddenly, turned a darker shade. Within an instant her anger kindled to such a degree her companions began trembling with an uneathly and holy fear. Her ferocity seemed to shake the very fabric of reality, fracturing the air around them. None of this seemed to frighten the intruder in the least. He just stared back at her, a serene look upon his face and he strolled closer into view.\n",
    "    \"How *dare* you!\" she roared, the lighthouse shuddering in her wake, \"How dare you bring your nonsense *here* of all places! This is more than a man's *life* we're talking about, not some whimsical concept in your befuddled mind! A man, who just so happens to be a very *dear* friend of mine. Yet *still* you've come uninvited and with you brought the audacity to spout off your insane ramblings and--as always-- speaking with that same venmous tone as you always do, as if *we* are the uninformed!\"\n",
    "    He said nothing in retort, but instead looked deeply into her eyes. The man had appeared silently. He hand't used a door. In fact, he didn't even climb the stairs to the top of the lighthouse where the three had gathered, and indeed, he had *not* been invited, but such things didn't matter, and yet was another reason he remained unafraid of this dreadfully perilous woman. They all three needed him, and they knew it--regardless of how illaccepted his presence was.\n",
    "    \"...But... he's right...\" said the man in the chair, a forlorn look upon his face as he paused in his smoking.\n",
    "    \"Indeed I am.\" He glared menacingly at the woman as he strolled all the more into view, \"I would *think* one of *The Preori* would *know better* than to confuse her *emotions* with the *facts*! Perhaps my dear, it's simply your humanity *finally* shining through?\" he asked with a slight smile forming upon his face, eyes twinkling in the dim light. He winked surreptitiously to the man in the chair.\n",
    "    The woman turned upon him again, but before she could unleash her rage, she was interrupted.\n",
    "    \"Listen you two...\" the man with the green eyes paused thoughtfully, \"it is *my* choice. You know he is already on his way--even now--We don't have *time* to sit around arguing. We know what *must* be done. There's only one way to ensure *The Connection* is made. Otherwise they'll delay it for as long as they can. You know how they work. *The Game* is rigged, and I know it goes against everything we stand for, but *if* we're going to win this war...\" he paused again, as if seeking the courage to continue on, \"and we *must*...We're going to *have* to get our hands dirty. There's simply no way around it.\"\n",
    "    The intruder interrupted once more--he was quite good at that, \"And *I* can think of none better suited to tread so deeply into darkened territory than you, and see to it the job gets done.\" he said satisfactorily.\n",
    "    The man in the chair covered his face in pain. The intruder *was* right, and now, all three of them knew it. The woman suddenly looked as if the wind had went out of her sails. The strange man's words cut through her like a knife, and right to the bone as so often they did. She *was* being emotional, just as he said, and *indeed*--it *was* due to her inability to deal with her... *unique* nature that was causing her to remain so thoroughly rattled. She hated how he always did this to her. Why had *she* been cursed with the blessing of existing in two worlds simultaneously? It *was* difficult being the only of her kind in all of existence. She had none with whom she could relate, and sometimes, *this* was the hardest part.\n",
    "    The green-eyed man thanked the intruder with a nod then continued, \"Listen I know none of this seems fair... to either one of you. Hell--none of it seems fair to me either. I'm not even sure I *can* do it. The fear alone is...\" his voice faltered, \"The thought itself is paralyzing... but... it *must* be done. This is after all just a game. A wicked one... but a game, neverhteless. I know what I mean to both of you. To say goodbye *indefinitely* is near unbearable for *me*, especially since it's all just a gamble anyway.\" he paused again, \"Things are so fragile and ... Unforseeable, but there's no way around it. *Someone* *has* to at the very lease try! We know He will remain to weak, unaware and forgetful to be of any use at all until *The Connection* has been made. Our only purpose is to ensure he is protected until that time comes.\" he took a deep breath, \"This *has* to end. All of it. All of these unsuspecting people... If we won't do it for the sake of getting the job done, then at least let us persist on their behalf. This *has* to end... It just...\" The green-eyed man's voice broke again with emotion as he remembered the true horror of what they were up against, \"It just... *has* to...\"\n",
    "    The intruder sighed pleasantly. He work was done. As usual, he'd completed his task without putting forth much effort at all. In fact, most of the time his mere presence was all that was necessary. It *had* been a long and arduous road. For ages it seemed he had interferred with the Dark Ones. It often left him isolated, even from his somewhat *mistrusting* allies. They never seemed to listen. They never chose to understand. But what he'd just heard comforted him greatly. The green-eyed man finally understood what was required, and even more, was willing to follow through. The intruder could ask for nothing more. Things must play out as they would.\n",
    "    You see, this was no ordinary man who was even now on his way. This was the *trump card*. The incalculable anomaly, sent to undo all of the evil instituted by *The Game*. *He* was the one they spoke of. The man referenced so frequently in *The Book*. All that remained was to wait for him to arrive, now that the green-eyed man understood his own path.\n",
    "    The woman sighed in frustration, \"I understand *why* such things are necessary. I...I just don't want to lose you. I've witnessed the two of you lose so much and it's heartbreaking enough... I'm not sure I can handle...\" her voice trailed off until she spoke mainly to herself, \"...Humanity is so... frail...\" she whispered."

    "# Chapter 1 : Follow Me - Complete Edits\n",
    "\n",
    "    He walked into Brian's life with very little warning or discretion at all, and though it was not a complete surprise--for Brian had knowledge of his own--A sliver of fear crept its way into his heart. The man had used his *real name* for one, and Brian had never met the man before. It was peculiar indeed. Strangers didn't often know his *real* name. Brian was in for a wild ride, and despite all that would soon come crashing into his life, fate could not have picked a more pecuiliarly *mundane* setting. Our story begins in a coffee shop one morning, as Brian sat there, checking his email.\n",
    "    \"Brian McCord, what are you doing with your life?\" the stranger asked abruptly, mocking him it seemed. No introduction. No opening woords. Just a blatant and somewhat rude, attention grabbing jeer. To Brian the man seemed fully intent on catching him off guard. However, Brian wasn't prone to such things.\n",
    "    He turned around, half expecting this. He'd felt it coming for some time. Though he had not known just when or where such a thing would manifest. When Brian looked up, the man was glaring back at him, eyes green and menacing. As it was not in Brian's nature to wear this emtions on his sleeve, he calmly lowered his sunglassings, meeting the gaze. Brian's steely grey eyes pierced into the man with a matched intensity. He smirked, attempting to throw *the stranger* off of *his* game.\n",
    "    The Stranger frowned knowingly, shaking his head, \"Oh don't give me that! You're absolutely terrified!\" he exclaimed, a sinister smile creeping across his face, his voice ending in a hiss, \"Do you know *who* I am?\", eyes flaring which hinted at some dark and hidden hunger. The stranger moved like a snake, repositioning himself in front of Brian's table.\n",
    "    At this Brian casually took his sunglasses the rest of the way off, laying them down and taking a drink of his coffee as if bored, but when he looked again, the man was nearly breathing down his throat.\n",
    "    \"It is time!\" he hissed, green eyes flashing with lightning it seemed. \n",
    "    Brian didn't so much as flinch, though... He probably should have. After all, he *hadn't* seen the man move, not even in his peripheral. One moment he'd been a safe distance away... and the next, he'd invaded Brians personal space, again - Intentionally.\n",
    "    Brian maintained his bored demeanor, \"And you ser are?\" he inquired nonchallantly.\n",
    "    An evil and knowing smile formed upon the stranger's lips, raising his eyebrows suggestively as he said, \"Oh... Don't you worry about that... Just follow me!\" and with that the strange man turned swiftly around, one arm behind his back as he strode confidently towards the door and upon exiting the cafe, flung the door open with a shove so forceful it nearly knocked over the elderly couple seeking to enter at that same time. He muttered something Brian couldn't make out however that appeared to offend the couple so much that nearly being hit with the door seem trivial at best. Odder still, he didn't so much as look back to make sure Brian followed, even after such a rude display of theatrics.\n",
    "    ...But Brian did follow. He didn't know why. He didn't even ponder it much. His feet began moving before he realized it, and for some reason, he let them go. It was as if he were being pulled by a current, against which there *could be no fighting*. That is not to say he necessarily *wanted* to combat it. Brian had known of this day for many years, and though he dreaded to see its arrival--partially for reasons he didn't yet understand--something about the man intrigued him. Plus, he was due for a date with a cigarette, and smoking wasn't allowed inside.\n",
    "    This was the excuse he used to quell the arrogance in his mind,  which seemed to disagree with him showing any interest in the least. You see, the *strangeness* of this event was not what led him to gather his laptop, coffee, and half-eaten breakfast. It was not the man's strange movements or speed which caused him to place his belongings into his car, lock it, then look around for the direction he had taken. No, not even the odd glimmer in the man's eyes which seemed more compelling than his knowledge of Brian's name had set his feet to walking, lighting a cigarette once he'd spotted him. None of this interested Brian at all. However, it was the *inexplicable* strangness of the walk itself that caused him to increase his pace, and this was very out of character for the young man. \n",
    "        Brian had noticed, by chance as it were, just how fast the man was walking and yet--somehow--the distance between them stayed fixed. Brian you see began following at his usual slow and steady, almost half-bored pace, unconcerned--or so he thought--with whether or not the man escaped his field of vision, but when Brian made *this* odd observation, he decided it best to test the crazed idea that surfaced in his mind. With all that had just transpired in the last few moments, what could it hurt to just *go with the flow*?\n",
    "        He began at first to walk slightly faster, gaging his speed with the steps of the strange man, who, as Brian also noted, had not bothered to look back, *not even once* to check on his progress. When it became apparent to him that the man had not sped up, nor that the distance between them had changed in the slightest--for Brian was exactly a full block behind him--He broke out into a slight job, carefully watching to ensure the man was indeed *still just walking*. Sure enough, the man's gait had not adjusted... but then again, neither had the distance between them.\n",
    "        This was not the first time somthing of this nature had appeared in Brian's life. He was twenty-three now, and until this point he'd always experienced periods of time--which fizzled out eventually--wherein it seemed as if the whole of the universe--God as some may call it--were attempting to tell him... *something*... Several times he'd followed hopelessly after various \"signs and wonders\" only to be let down in the end, as his extra-sensory perception of the world slowly slipped away into oblivion, leaving him questioning everything all the more.\n",
    "        He'd written it off as a dream the first time he'd been approached in a like manner. He was only nine at the time, though the man he'd encountered then had been quite the opposite of this *new stranger*. He had made a point of ignoring all of the other odd people who'd come afterwards, each saying strange things and beckoning him to follow them. Despite this he'd never managed to shake his questions as to just *who* that first man had been.\n",
    "        At nineteen he sat for weeks, alone in his bedroom poring over a large stack of books and compiling hundreds of seemingly deranged and disjointed notes. When he emerged, he ventured into the wilderness nearby and found that very same man in a small cabin, deep in the obscure forest... At the very least he knew that man was indeed real and not just some figment within his imagination. This revelation had troubled him deeply. When the man asked how he'd come to find his cabin, Brian had said that he'd simply \"Followed The Stars\".\n",
    "        By twenty-one he'd grown quite comfortable with the apparently hidden realm of knowledge he'd somehow stumbled upon which seemed so contradictory towards what most considered \"Reality\". Indeed, there had often been times throughout Brian's life when random things--seemingly unrelated events--would occur in accordance with his thoughts, as though everything around him knew him personally. For the most part, by now he'd learned it best simply to ignore such sensations. Nevermind the fact he could no longer explain away the existence of the man in the cabin--He'd realized rather painfully however, that far too often following after such strange thoughts always left him at a dead-end. A barren space--wherein things were neither resolved, nor truly broken.\n",
    "        He'd also learned it was best to keep quiet about such things after one evenings chat with his sisters--one older, the other younger. They'd immediately pointed him in the direction of a psychiatric ward, citing various articles on the dangers of *schizophrenia*. He actually had taken their advice at one point. A time when his mind seemed to be unravelling by the seams, but when he'd told the doctor he feared he was going insane, the man had laughed at him, then reassuringly said, \"No my boy, you see, crazy people don't *know* they're crazy.\" and suggested he simply try to get more sleep. \n",
    "        Braight tried to take everything in stide, and despite possessing a very powerful \"sixth sense\" or intuitive notion about *most* things, he now rarely let himself become too enmeshed with the narrative's inherent drama. He routinely ignored the underlying strangeness of the world around him, blending it all in rather nicely with the rest of the odd characters he encountered--people who seemed to know him in some fashion or another--which is why his reaction on *this* day was quite out of the ordinary indeed.\n",
    "        He began running after the jogging experiment failed to bring him *any* closer to the man. He was now convinced there was *indeed* some sort of a gulf fixed between them, as if--dare he say--by magic, as it were. The pursuit seemed to go on for at least a good half-hour. He'd tried everything he could to close or even extend the gap, but it was all in vain. Once Brian even stopped entirely but it too was to no avail. The man just kept on goin, yet never seemed to get any further away. Brian curiously found himself suddenly actually *wanting* to talk to the stranger after all. *This* was most *definitely* out of character for the young man.\n",
    "        After leading Brian to a rather poor looking side of town, the man turned swiftly down an alleyway, in between two apartment buildings. As Brian rounded the corner, he saw the man open a door, then slam it closed behind him. His eyes widended. He made his way past the dangling clothesline and bits of scattered trash that littered the alleyway, and then came acrtoss yet *another* bewitching and auspicious symbol. He stared, transfixed by the numbers which glared back at him.\n",
    "        Throughout Brian's odd life a tapestry of patterened and coded number schemes inexplicably seemed to not only appear, but also somehow hed a specific meaning he had no rational means of explaining. The timing of their appearances always emphasized this in dramatic and impossible ways. This phenomenon did nothing to change what he felt, nor dull the shocking intensity this particular configuration inflicted however. The number in question was one that had haunted him ever since his mother died. He was only sixteen at the time and she had just turned forty. You see the apartment was labeled six-hundred fourteen, and to Brian, any combination of the three numbers, one, six and four, had always said to him the same thing. *Death!* plain and simple.\n",
    "        He thought for a breif moment of leaving. Returning to his car and going home, but luckily for us all, his ego urged him onward. Without any further hesitation or outward show of fear, he confidently turned the handle, only to find the door dead bolted. This baffled him profusely, and after giving the knob another futile turn, he decided instead to knock, unsure suddenly if the man he'd follow even existed. \n",
    "        On his third knock and almost instride with his hand, the door swung open and a different voice met him. \n",
    "        \"Ah Mr. Johnson, it's so nice to *finally* meet you. Please, won't you come inside?\"\n",
    "        This was not the voice of the man he'd followed. no, this was not the same man at all.\n",
    "        \"We've been waiting for you,\" a familiar and snakelike voice concluded.\n",
    "        As Brian peered inside he saw the man with the green eyes. He sat in a large velvet recliner, and was smiling wickedly back at him.\n",
    "        \"Please, come in.\" said the man at the door once more. He was short and chubby - wearing th eoddest of clothes. A full tuxedo.\n",
    "        Brian was now unsettled to say the least. In fact, he'd secretly hoped it was indeed all just a hallucination. The man he had followed was not real at all, and the whole thing had been a farce--yet there he sate, just inside, smiling sinisterly. He again began to doubt his choice to ever abandon his breakfast. He stood there hesitantly, attempting to assess the safety of the situation from behind his dark sunglasses. He naturally felt as though he were being deceived in some fashion. \n",
    "        The man in the tux though was insistent and began gesturing with his hand, \"Please Mr. Johnson, *do* come inside, we have *much* to discuss.\"\n",
    "        \"How do you know my name?\" asked Brian sternly, once more on the defensive.\n",
    "        The man had such an inviting face, round and comforting, upon it wearing a warm smile, but when Brain said this, the smile just... disappeared...\n",
    "        \"Yes! How *does* he known you're *name* Mr. McCord?\" hissed the green-eyed man from his chair, \"Come in please so Elvis can shut the door!\"\n",
    "        Brian laughed to himself, though his face did not show it. The man at the door indeed looked like a shorter, fattter, rendition of Elvis. However, the irony of the situation didn't lower Brian's guard in the slightest. If anything, it caused him to be all the more cautious. These men knew both his real name and alias--he'd put quite a bit of energy and money into keep the correlation from becoming public knowledge. They seemed to be mocking him about it. He wasn't yet fully persuaded, and he had a sense their intentions weren't as pure as they seemed to be trying so desparately to suggest--though they also seemed not to care much about hiding their subterfuge either."

    "\n",
    "    Feeling suddenly as if he could reassert control, Brian decided to test their resolve.\n",
    "    \"No... You tell me *now* how both of you seemingly know me... or I'm going home.\"\n",
    "    Much to his surprise, they responded rather oppositely than he expected. You see, Brian thought they needed *him* for something, and the idea had not yet crossed his mind that it infact was the other way around. \n",
    "    The two men looked at each other, shrugged in unison, and said \"Have it your way.\"\n",
    "    Elvis slammed the door shut. \n",
    "    Brian heard the deadbolt slide back into place, and after a few breif seconds of confusion, knocked once more. *Again a most unnature choice of actions on his part* Normally, despite the strangeness, Brian actually would have just left, purposefully forgetting about the whole affair, but *something* seemed to refuse to allow him this privilege.\n",
    "    When the door opened again, Brian wasted no time before confidently striding inside. He said nothing, and when the door shut behind him the room grew dark, forcing him to remove his sunglasses. The only light infact was a small lamp sitting on an end table, situated in the far corner between the recliner and sofa. The room was neat. *too neat* it seemed, especially for this side of town. The books upon the shelves were all in aphabetical order and the white high pile carpet was pristine. The light from the lamp bounced off the walls, giving the room an eerie yellowish glow. The window had been boarded up, and over it hung a portrait of a dashingly beautiful woman dressed in a thin white gown, her long, silvery-blonde hair brushed neatly over the front of her shoulders. The parquet inlay near the door seemed polished as it gleamed in the dim light.\n",
    "    \"Oh please, do have a seat Mr. McCord, there are some things we would like to go over with you.\" said the stranger with the green eyes, gesturing him towards the couch, \"And don't worry, we'll tell you *everything* you want to know, but first,\" the man pointed once more, \"You must sit.\"\n",
    "    \"Would you like some tea Mr. Johnson?\" the fat man asked.\n",
    "    Brian made his way across the room, \"No *Elvis*, but thank you.\" he replied, a hint of sarcasm in his tone. He glanced up at the portrait over the window as he passed, feeling a shiver run first down, and then back up his spine as he did. It seemed as though her gaze had pierced through to his very soul as it were, and she seemed... vaguely familiar.\n",
    "    It was clear though the aparment was situated in the very worst part of town, no poor man lived here, and odder still, as Brian sat down and sank into his seat, he also got the sense that though everything *looked* new, it had all been there for a very, very long time.\n",
    "    \"Well, now that you're seated, and don't want any tea, let's get down to business shall we?\" asked the stranger in the recliner, his green eyes flickering in the dim light, smiling evilly.\n",
    "    \"Yes...\" Brian said hesitantly, \"Let's...\"\n",
    "    At this point the man began spewing forth a torrent of words, as though he'd been waiting for a *very long time* for this exact moment, and though Brian had the same exaggerated look of boredom upon his face, he was *quite* interested, but only because he was suddenly overcome with a very intense feeling of deja vu as he stared at the man.\n",
    "    \"First things first, that is not *The Elvis*, I know he resembles him in an odd sort of way, but just get that out of your head. You're not crazy. Remember that.\" which was an odd thing to hear, because at that very moment, Brian had begun to very seriously question that very thing.\n",
    "    \"My name,\" the stranger continued, placing his hands dramatically upon his chest, \"Is Ricco, and yours is Brian McCord, Tracy Johnson, or whatever other ridiculous thing it is that you want to be called.\"\n",
    "    The man's somewhat ecstatic manner set Brian on edge once more. He interrupted his speech.\n",
    "    \"Well, that about handles introductions. Do you want to tell me why it is that I followed you?\" Brian asked.\n",
    "    \"Ah yes, that is an excellent question.\" he leaned forward, an eyebrow cocked as he smiled back wickedly at Brian, \"Why *did* you follow me?\"\n",
    "    Brian was thrown off by this and for the first time it showed upon his face as his eyes went wide.\n",
    "    The man eyed him curiously for a moment, and then suddenly, with great excitement he said, \"I think it's time we finally told him everything Elvis!\"\n",
    "    \"Yes... Yes it is Fenningway. As I always say, strike while the iron is hot!\"\n",
    "    Brian caught himself. Where had he heard that name before? Ricco Fenningway... He thought to himself.\n",
    "    \"Fenningway...? Did you... Did you just say, Fenningway, as in A.R. Fenningway?\"\n",
    "    Ricco stared back at Brian, his smile gone, his face assuming a look of dire intensity.\n",
    "    \"Yes Mr. McCord,\" he began even toned, staring down his nose \"A. R. Fenningway. Alfred Ricco Fenningway to be exact, your sixth grade math and science teacher. Do you remember me now?\"\n",
    "    Brian noticed that as the man leaned back into his recliner, he cut his eyes towards the portrait over the window, ever so subtly.\n",
    "    \"But... you don't look anything like the man I once knew.\"\n",
    "    \"And you don't *look* anything like an old student of mine, but you are and I am.\" he said in a tone that seemed disgusted wiht Brian's ignorance.\n",
    "    Poor Brian was now more confused than he thought he had been already, but he didn't let on to it just yet. He casually returned to his bored demeanor, \"What ever do you mean Mr. Fenningway,\" he asked, sounding perturnbed.\n",
    "    Elvis met Brain's wandering gaze as he looked away from the chair, smiling brightly and suddenly at him when he did, seemingly overjoyed about something.\n",
    "    \"Don't you call me *mister* anything!\" screamed Fenningway, pointing a finger warningly, directly into Brian's face. Again, Brian didn't flinch, although most people would have. He hadn't seen Fenningway move. One moment the man was calmly sitting back in the recliner, and the next he was mere inches from Brian's face, seething with anger. \n",
    "    \"Sit *down* Ricco! Sit down!\" barked Elvis, a new tone darkening his previously cheerful voice.\n",
    "    \"I have to apologize for my friend, you see, he hates for anyone to show him any sort of respect or common courtesy, such as saying *mister* or referring to him as *sir*.\" \n",
    "    \"So do I...\" said Brian curiously.\n",
    "    \"Well then, there we have it!\" exclaimed Fenningway, jumping up once more, finger raised high into the air this time.\n",
    "    \"I said sit down!\" Elvis roared.\n",
    "    Suddenly the warm and inviting faced seemed to be *much* more of a disguise than a reality.\n",
    "    \"Oh... yes.\" said Fenningway sheepishly, \"Sorry about that.\"\n",
    "    Elvis' demeanor shifted back to that of friendly, and Brian marveled secretly at the suddenness of it.\n",
    "    \"My name,\" Elvis continued, \"Is Elvis Harker. I haven't ever met you before, but Fenningway here has. There's a lot to explain, and not much time to do so, so I must insist that you keep your questions to a minimum, as I'm sure we'll get to them sooner or later, and those that we don't will simply answer themselves anyway in their own time.\" The man smiled brightly at him once more.\n",
    "    Brian nodded. He was now sure that *these two men* were insane, not himself."

    "    \"Are you comfortable Mr. Johnson? Is there anything that we can do to accomodate you?\" Harker asked, pulling an ashtray from seemingly nowhere, placing it upon the table in front of him.\n",
    "    The table itself was stranger still. In its center lay a vase with eleven white roses, with a solitary red one placed in precisely the center.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \"I do apologize for my antics earlier, and my seeming dodging of your questions, but I simply *had* to entice you to follow me and to do that I had to be quite rude, but as you've said, you do understand?\" asked Fenningway, an eager gleam in his eye as he paused momentarily. When Brian just stared back blankly he continued on, \"Well, at least you *did* decide to follow after all, abandoning that psychobabble nonsense about not following after such delusions!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    A slight smile formed upon Fenningway's face, which he made no attempt to conceal, and in it Brian saw, ever so breifly, a side to the man that he had seemed to be working very hard to keep hidden from Harker. Just as quickly as it had appeared however, it was gone. Brian tightened his jaw.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"*Is* this a delusion?\" Brian asked in a dejected tone, \"*Am* I really here right now? Are you even real?\", becoming more and more confused with each passing moment.\n",
    "    \"Oh, very much so Sir!\" Harker said almost as soon as the words had left Brian's lips.\n",
    "    Brian cringed, unsure of whether the man had intended to say yes to all three of his questions, \"Well, now that we've all made our introductions, would you mind explaining to me what exactly is happening, if I'm *not* losing my mind?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Brian was becoming unhinged by the fact that despite all the dramaturgy, the conversation seemed to be going nowhere and only served to both confuse and intrigue him the longer it continued.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"Yes... we can, and we will... as soon as you relax a bit - And we can't until you do, and as we've stated, we don't have much time so please... sit back and get comfortable. Take it all in and try to get over the shock of the... shall we say, *unnatural nature* of all this. It is *your* destiny we're talking about after all.\" Harker said with a laugh as he got up and went into another darkened area of the dwelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Brian leaned back and closed his eyes, taking measured intentional breaths. Time ceased to have meaning and he nearly forgot all about the men, the room, the strange day. He was brought out of his micro meditation when Harker returned with a tray with three cups of hot tea. \n",
    "\n",
    "    \"He's relaxed now.\" said Fenningway abruptly.\n",
    "    Brian's eyes slowly opened at hearing this.\n",
    "    \"Hmmm... Yes... Indeed he is. We had best this underway.\" replied Harker\n",
    "    \"Well, let's begin.\" said Brian, abandoning his apathy, deciding the two men would simply continue running in circlies if he did not at least *appear* to have dropped his guard.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Harker began immediately, \"You Sir are one Brian A. McCord. You're married to a Martha B. McCord and you both live in a quiet subdivision over on the nicer side of town. This morning, you drove your wife to the coffee shop at the end of fifth stree so she could meet up with friends, spend the day shopping and have a nice \"Girls Day Out\",\" he made airquotes with his fingers, \" You watched her leave with her friends at precisely 8:51AM, and as you proceeded to check your email, fully intent to finish your breakfast, you were ... interrupted, and now you're here.\" He pointed *at* Brian, a deeply intense look in his eye, \"You followed Fenningway, which is indeed most uncharacteristic of you, and now you expect for *us* to tell *you* why.\" Harker cocked an eyebrow whimsically before continuing, \"While the decision *was* ultimately your own, I must explain further your reasoning - because for some strange reason - you do not wish to allow for your mind to accept the *obvious truth*. That of course being that you followed Fenningway today because of something that has happened to you throughout your entire life!\"\n",
    "    Harker continued to speak, gesturing with his arms as he did, \"Strange people - they show up and gesture for you to follow them and they, like Fenningway here, seem to know *far* too much about you and offer no explaination about any of it. You've never followed after any of them... until now, but this day is different! Would you like to know why Sir?\"\n",
    "    Brian wasn't as taken aback by this as it seemed he probably should be. Things were starting to add up - Hard *had* been right in telling him to needed to relax. He'd however been wrong in stating Brian had never followed *anyone* before. The old man from the cabin in the woods drifted into his mind. No amount of relaxation caused him to make more sense of anything taking place - for it was all coming in much too fast to process, but at least now he was *capable* of simply listening. What true harm could *words* cause anyhow? It no longer frightened him that these two men somehow seemed intimately familiar with his inner life and private affairs, but it comforted him to take notice that he still had *some* secrets it seemed. The old man's face appeared in his mind once more. Brian didn't care. He had to get to the bottom of this strange day, and the only way he was going to would be by giving in, and simply allowing the two of them to ramble on.\n",
    "    In a very calm and even tone he responded, \"No... I don't know why *this* day is any different than the rest.\"\n",
    "    \"Because today is the day you were finally ready! That's how *we* found you before *they* did!\" Harker exclaimed as if it were the most obvious of facts.\n",
    "    \"Indeed we did... and this world is very lucky it *was* us... and not them.\" added Fenningway softly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Brian was just about to ask what they meant by this - Were the other strange people who had beckoned him previously been sent looking for him, hoping to lead him away for some undisclosed and potentially dangerous purpose as well? Had they been more actively lately and he had simply not been paying attention? If so, what made it such a lucky happenstance that *these* two had seduced him first? Or was this simply another method of attempting to deepen his trust of them? To what lengths would their psychological subversion tactics go?\n",
    "    He decided instead to simply let them talk. They indeed seemed deranged to him anyway, plus he had nothing better to do with his day. *Ready for what?* he wondered to himself silently.\n",
    "    Seeing something of the question in his eyes, Fenningway spoke up, \"Tell me boy,\" he leaned in close to Brian's face once more, \"Do you know what *the Nastaku* are?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    If anything could have shuffled Brian's cards more, it was that name. *Where* *had* he heard it before?! *Why* was it so troubling to him? Was it from some dream he'd had? Or... was it a memory from waking life? He honestly wasn't sure, but he knew the name was most certainly not foreign to his ears.\n",
    "    \"You see Tracy, it's okay to talk about them in the DayLight. We're quite safe! They can't get to us...\" Harker paused, \"But... you already knew that... didn't you?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"*No*\" is what Brian intended to say, but as his lips moved, another word came out, unbidden, \"Yes...\" he whispered, confused as to why he had said it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \"So you *do* know what they are!\" exclaimed Fenningway, leaning on the edge of his seat, a twinkle of dark pleasure filling his eye.\n",
    "    \"Oh come off it man!\" scolded Harker, \"Of course he doesn't know *what* they are, he hasn't met one... yet.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Brian now openly brandished a look of bewilderment he couldn't have hidden if he tried. His understanding of not understanding had been shattered by the slip of his own tongue. A slip which clearly hinted at the fact -- somehow -- somewhere deep within -- he *did* infact understand -- at least in part.\n",
    "    Fenningway began to say something more but was cut off again sharply by Harker.\n",
    "    \"Okay, enough of this. You...\" He pointed at Fenningway, his voice once more darkened by some preternatural and inhuman rage, \"Not... another... word...\" He spun around to face Brian once more, the nice and innocently decent facade resumed, \"And you Sir....\" he wagged his finger, shaking his head as a fake laugh formed upon his face, \"I want *you* to listen to me *very carefully* okay?\" he seemed to beg the man with his eyes to acquiesce.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Brian just nodded, taking a cigarette from his pack. He had to calm his nerves. Every second this conversation continued served to do nothing except present more questions.\n",
    "    \"Tracy Johnson,\" he began, once more using Brain's pen name, \"have you ever gotten the feeling that everything you see is not... the *true* reality? Have you ever felt that the stories you read in a ficticious novel were perhaps more real than even seems possible? Have you ever had the feeling that you are ... important... even though few people know your *true name*? Have you even felt *destined* for greatness?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Of course Brian had such feelings. They'd haunted him his whole life.\n",
    "    \"Sure, everyone does...\" he replied, not liking the notion that he was somehow special -- which was part of his problem -- but Harker's next words stopped him in his tracks, mainly because Brian was thinking the very same thing, even as the man spoke.\n",
    "    \"No Mr. Johnson, they don't!\" Harker's voice now took on a grave tone, \"not in the way you do. Sure, people feel destiny tug at them from time to time, but most just go about thie lives, ignoring it entirely,\" he started pacing, waving his finger once more at Brian and shaking his head, \"but *this* thought... *this* idea... it...\" he looked up and caught Brian's ever widening eyes, \"*consumes* you!\"\n",
    "    Brian could feel his heart skip a beat.\n",
    "    Harker waved his finger with more vigor, taking a few broad steps towards him, \"In fact... I'd wager if it weren't for that wife of yours, you'd never have grown up to become a productive member of society -- You find no point in it even now. No...\" he wagged his finger again, cutting his eyes back sinisterly towards Brian as if the baffled man were being coy, feigning confusion, and he'd just caught him in the act, \"You've been ... waiting for something. Youre entire life until *this* point has been nothing more than a... resting place for you until fate came along to sweep you off on some grand adventure.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    The cigarette dropped from Brian's mouth in the wake of his astonishment - By the time he realized what happened, the carpet had already been singed.\n",
    "    \"I'm sorry!\" he said, extinguishing the cigarette in the ashtray sheepishly.\n",
